# PARCEL + BABEL + Typescript (ES2020) + SASS - Basic Setup

A basic boilerplate setup to use in a modern frontend workflow for small to medium-sized projects.

## Building and running on localhost

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To run in hot module reloading mode:

```sh
npm start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Credits

The setup was partly created with [createapp.dev](https://createapp.dev/) and was also inspired by [bradtraversy/vanilla-parcel-boilerplate](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanilla-parcel-boilerplate). It adds a default browserlist and autoprefixer to avoid needing to write vendor-specific prefixes in CSS. It also comes with a basic typescript configuration. Feel free to customize any configuration files or change the filestructure to your needs.
